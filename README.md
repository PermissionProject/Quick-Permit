<h1 align="center">Quick Permit</h1>

## Description :
The motive behind our project is to have a hassle-free system to seek permissions from college to simplify the otherwise cumbersome process observed.
The idea is to send and approve/reject permission requests for conducting events/sessions in college on one single platform.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 types of users - Student, Teacher, Admin <br/> <br/>
•  <b> Student </b>- <br/>
Students have the option to join clubs and send Permission Forms for conducting events/sessions in college as well as sending Leave Forms to specific teachers. <br/><br/>
• <b>Teacher </b>- <br/>
Teachers can approve/reject permission requests of clubs they coordinate. <br/><br/>
• <b> Admin </b>-<br/>
Admin has all the powers - They can Schedule an event, Create a new club, Create a new event, Add users to the platform and many more. You can say that the Admin gets an overview of the entire system.  <br/>
